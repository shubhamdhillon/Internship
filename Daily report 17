I know its been several days and i'm really sorry for that so i'll continue the course from where i left it, so i learned about The 
internal modifiers. It has the same access semantics as the public keyword with the exception of restricting access to code in our own program
assembly. 
This means that we can create code that can only be accessed from our own code.
