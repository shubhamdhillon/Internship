So today is the 5th day of my Intership an today I learned about the comments, what are they and why are they used. Comments really are a 
critical part of a program, they help other programmers or observers to let know what's going on in the program and how it's written.
I also learnt the syntax of multiple line comment in a program.I practiced writing the single line as well as multiple line comments in the
pre-written programs.
After this i read a little about the SurveyBuilder app that we discussed earlier which we are going to build in the SurveyBuilder corner.
Then at the end of the Hello World section i got to the last part i.e Deep Dive in which i re-memorised all the things and terms i learned in 
this section like namespaces their use, using directives,comments etc. Hence with the conclusion part i completed my Hello World section.
