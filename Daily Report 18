 on the 18th day i finished the going on topic Visibility and Accessibility Modes. Throughout this section i learned a great deal of 
new stuff i.e why we use the access specifier modes that we have been using since previous sections and other Internal modes and i got a 
chance to practice several working exercises on the topics under this section.
Collectively this section was a little more fun than the 'Classes' section because of the easier content i guess so although the week has been
a tough ride managing between the sessionals and the course.
