It's my 4th day with the C# course and I'm back after the weekend. So in my previous section i learned about using the Console.WriteLine but in today's 
session i learned what exactly is Console and how do we use it. So to be able to use the console class in our program we need to add the using 
directives in the program. So here i got to know why exactly we write using System on the top of the program, System is actually one of the 
few namespaces provided by the .NET Framework to us in order to use instead of the fully-qualified names.
So with this information i practised and solved some error ridden programs and made the programs with and without the use of using Directives.
At the end i also learned about how to write a comment and the use of comment of how it's used to notify other programers about the program and
how it's made.
