So with completion of the 'Hello World' section I've reached the 'Using the Console' part, in it's overview i learned that I'll be studying how to 
use console, make changes to it and how to read the input provided by the user.
So to start with firstly i learned what exactly is the console, Console has been one of a feature of OS since starting, they are used to 
read the information or input provided by the user and then display the feedback on an output display. While working on the exercise i came
to know about the feature Intellisense which displays suggestion on Visual studio wherever required. I also practiced writing multiple 
statements in a single program. I learned the basic difference between Console.WriteLine and Console.Write is that with .Write we need to 
manually add a move to new line option which is not a case in .WriteLine , with this i did the few interactive examples too provided on this 
case study.
