Today I started the new section of Hello World in the tutorial and with it's introduction i got to know about what i'll be doing in the whole Hello 
World section. I learned about the syntax of a basic C# program and the how the commands work, the uses of comments and statements. 
The next phase of the section is Main method in which i learned about the working and execution of syntax along with the working of the 
Console.WriteLine.
One important tip i got today was to always check the semicolons first if an error occurs.
