Today was my first day of the internship and my first step in the C# course. 
On reading the introduction to the C# tutorial i got an overwiew of the programming environment in which i'll be working. I became friendly with 
the working environment of NET Academy and the advantages of .NET Fiddle and Visual studio.
I also learned about the static and interactive codes and the benefits of interactive coding of how we can write and see the codes within the 
browser and see the change in real time.
