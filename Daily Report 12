Yesterday after learning about the Classes and how they are made I did a few exercises on how to define my own classes, after practicing a few
methods I learned some new methods to use in syntax. The next thing i learned is how to add some properties in the syntax like First name and
Last name etc, I learned how to add everything I'm learning in the syntax.
Today was really a workout day, I did a lot of Exercises related to class and its functions, how methods and properties like name, date of 
birth, roll no. are added and this whole time was worth it, I really did learn a lot of stuff.
