Today is my 2nd day of the internship and with this i completed the Introduction section of the C# beginners tutorial.
I got to know a cool way of really enjoying the coding with the working exercise section in which one can write,reset and verify the commands
on a single screen. I also learnt how i can actually use my coding skills in the real world by making an app called Survey Builder.
  I am really enjoying my learning section with the .NET Academy.
