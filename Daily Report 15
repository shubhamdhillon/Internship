Today i started a new section Visibility and Accessibility modes, the section explains the Public,Private and Protected access modifiers though. I've been using these modifiers in previous
sections too but this whole section explains the importance and use of the access specifiers. Access modifiers are the most commonly used
modifiers in most C# program code.
These modifiers are used to control what levels of access you want to apply to your types, and type members such as methods and properties.
Then I individually studied all the three specifiers.
